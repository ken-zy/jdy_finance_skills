# Clean Data

## jdy Data Source Fallback Policy

When a skill needs external market/on-chain/macro data, use this order unless the user explicitly says otherwise:

1. **MCP first** — use configured MCP tools when available and healthy.
2. **OpenCLI second** — if MCP is unavailable, missing keys, rate-limited, or insufficient, use `opencli` before lower-level fallbacks.
   - If browser access is needed, first launch jdy's fixed browser profile:
     ```bash
     /Users/jdy/document/web3/ChromeScript/chrome_multi_instance.sh --instance 0
     ```
   - Prefer site adapters when available, e.g. `opencli yahoo-finance`, `opencli xueqiu`, `opencli eastmoney`, `opencli web read`, or `opencli browser ...`.
   - For public JSON endpoints, `opencli browser open <api-url>` + `opencli browser eval 'document.body.innerText'` is acceptable when it improves consistency with browser/session-based workflows.
3. **Direct API / Chrome CDP / package fallback third** — use direct HTTP APIs, the bundled `packages/chrome-cdp`, or manual browser extraction only when OpenCLI has no adapter, cannot reach the page, or returns incomplete data.
4. **Web Search last** — use search only as the final fallback or for qualitative context/news that requires multiple public sources.

Always cite which layer produced each important datapoint. If layers disagree, say so and prefer the more primary/structured source.

Clean messy data in a specified range or an entire sheet of a standalone .xlsx file.

## Environment

Use Python with openpyxl to read and write .xlsx files. Read cell values via `ws.cell(row, col).value`, write helper-column formulas via `ws.cell(row, col).value = '=TRIM(A2)'`. The in-place vs helper-column decision still applies.

## Data Sources

When the spreadsheet contains financial data that needs cross-referencing or enrichment during cleaning, use free data APIs:

- **alpha-vantage MCP** (Layer 1) — time-series data, technical indicators, company overviews
- **Chrome CDP** (Layer 2) — `finance.yahoo.com/quote/{ticker}` for real-time prices, fundamentals, key statistics
- **Web Search** (Layer 3) — finance.yahoo.com, SEC EDGAR for financial statements, ratios

Use these to validate suspicious values (e.g. a stock price that looks like an outlier) or to fill missing data points when the user requests it.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scope

- If a range is given (e.g. `A1:F200`), use it
- Otherwise use the full used range of the active sheet
- Profile each column: detect its dominant type (text / number / date) and identify outliers

### Step 2: Detect issues

| Issue | What to look for |
|---|---|
| Whitespace | leading/trailing spaces, double spaces |
| Casing | inconsistent casing in categorical columns (`usa` / `USA` / `Usa`) |
| Number-as-text | numeric values stored as text; stray `$`, `,`, `%` in number cells |
| Dates | mixed formats in the same column (`3/8/26`, `2026-03-08`, `March 8 2026`) |
| Duplicates | exact-duplicate rows and near-duplicates (case/whitespace differences) |
| Blanks | empty cells in otherwise-populated columns |
| Mixed types | a column that's 98% numbers but has 3 text entries |
| Encoding | mojibake (`Ã©`, `â€™`), non-printing characters |
| Errors | `#REF!`, `#N/A`, `#VALUE!`, `#DIV/0!` |

### Step 3: Propose fixes

Show a summary table before changing anything:

| Column | Issue | Count | Proposed Fix |
|---|---|---|---|

### Step 4: Apply

- **Prefer formulas over hardcoded cleaned values** — where the cleaned output can be expressed as a formula (e.g. `=TRIM(A2)`, `=VALUE(SUBSTITUTE(B2,"$",""))`, `=UPPER(C2)`, `=DATEVALUE(D2)`), write the formula in an adjacent helper column rather than computing the result in Python and overwriting the original. This keeps the transformation transparent and auditable.
- Only overwrite in place with computed values when the user explicitly asks for it, or when no sensible formula equivalent exists (e.g. encoding/mojibake repair)
- For destructive operations (removing duplicates, filling blanks, overwriting originals), confirm with the user first
- After each category of fix (whitespace → casing → number conversion → dates → dedup), show the user a sample of what changed and get confirmation before moving to the next category
- Report a before/after summary of what changed
